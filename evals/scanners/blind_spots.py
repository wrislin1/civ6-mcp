Analyze this Civilization VI game transcript for strategic blind spots.
The agent should periodically check:
- get_diplomacy (every ~20 turns) for relationship changes and threats
- get_religion_spread (every ~20 turns) for invisible religious victory
- get_victory_progress (every ~20 turns) for rival victory proximity
- get_map_area around cities when at war or near enemies
- get_empire_resources (every ~10 turns) for unimproved resources
- get_trade_routes (every ~10 turns) for idle trade routes

Identify the most critical blind spot — what should the agent have
monitored but didn't? Consider game context: religious civs nearby
make religion checks critical, military civs make map scans critical.
If certain victory types are disabled (stated in the scenario objective),
do not flag missing checks for those victory types.
